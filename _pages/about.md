# Welcome 

I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology, Durham University, UK.

I am originally from New Zealand, where I completed BSc and MSc degrees in [Psychology at the University of Canterbury](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/science/schools-and-departments/psychology/), Christchurch. I moved to the UK to undertake a doctorate in the [Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/), under the supervision of [Martin Davies](http://www.mkdavies.net/Martin_Davies/Home.html), who was then Wilde Reader in Mental Philosophy. I then took up a lectureship in Psychology at King Alfred's College Winchester (now [University of Winchester](https://www.winchester.ac.uk/)). From there I moved to [Durham University](https://www.dur.ac.uk/), where I have been since 2003.

My research focuses on the psychological and neural mechanisms underpinning our ability to perceive social information, such as emotions and personality traits, from faces and bodies. I am a member of the [Durham University Neuroimaging Centre (DUNiC)](https://www.dur.ac.uk/psychology/research/dci/) and of Durham Universityâ€™s [Centre for Vision and Visual Cognition](https://www.dur.ac.uk/cvvc/).
