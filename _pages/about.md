# Welcome to the Atkinson lab for Social Perception

## About me:
I am a Professor in the [Department of Psychology, Durham University](https://www.dur.ac.uk/psychology/), UK.

I am originally from New Zealand, where I completed BSc and MSc degrees in [Psychology at the University of Canterbury](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/study/subjects/psychology/), Christchurch. I moved to the UK to undertake a doctorate in the [Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/), under the supervision of [Martin Davies](http://www.mkdavies.net/Martin_Davies/Home.html), who was then Wilde Reader in Mental Philosophy. I then took up a lectureship in Psychology at King Alfred's College Winchester (now [University of Winchester](https://www.winchester.ac.uk/)). From there I moved to [Durham University](https://www.dur.ac.uk/), where I have been since 2003. I have held visiting research fellowships at the University of York (2001; host: Prof [Andy Young](https://www.york.ac.uk/psychology/staff/emeritusfaculty/awy1/)) and the University of Iowa (2004; host: Prof [Ralph Adolphs](http://emotion.caltech.edu/)).

I am a member of the [Durham Centre for Imaging (DCI)](https://www.dur.ac.uk/psychology/research/centres/imaging/), of Durham University’s [Centre for Vision and Visual Cognition](https://www.dur.ac.uk/cvvc/), and of the Department of Psychology's [Cognitive Neuroscience](https://www.dur.ac.uk/psychology/research/groups/cognitive/) research group.

## About the lab:
Our research focuses on the psychological and neural mechanisms underpinning our ability to perceive social information, such as emotions and personality traits, from faces and bodies. Current projects include:
- foveal vs. extrafoveal processing of features within faces underpinning emotion perception, with [Hannah Smithson](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/team/hannah-smithson) (Oxford University) and former PhD student (now Assistant Professor) [Nazire Duran](https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/nazire-duran/). This work is guided by the principles that vision is active rather than passive and that there are quantitative and qualitative differences between foveal and extrafoveal (or peripheral) vision that determine how we see and how we interact with the world.
- visual perception of social interactions, with [Quoc Vuong](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/ion/staff/profile/quocvuong.html#background) (Newcastle University)

We are also engaging in collaborative work on visuomotor control (with [Dorothy Cowie](https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/dorothy-cowie/) and former PhD student [Rachel Mowbray](https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/rachel-mowbray/) and visual attention (with [Dan Smith](https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/daniel-smith2/) and [Alison Lane](https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/a-r-lane/)), and on social cognition and communication in primates (with [Zanna Clay](https://www.durham.ac.uk/staff/zanna-e-clay/), [Mariska Kret](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/mariska-kret#tab-1) and [Raphaela Heesen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FM_pjS8AAAAJ&hl=en)).
