# Welcome 

I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology, Durham University, UK.

I am originally from New Zealand, where I completed BSc and MSc degrees in Psychology at the University of Canterbury, Christchurch. I moved to the UK to undertake a doctorate in the Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford, after which I moved to a lectureship at King Alfred's College Winchester. From there I moved to Durham, where I have been since 2003.
