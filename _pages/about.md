# Welcome 

I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology, Durham University, UK.

I am originally from New Zealand, where I completed BSc and MSc degrees in [Psychology at the University of Canterbury](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/science/schools-and-departments/psychology/), Christchurch. I moved to the UK to undertake a doctorate in the [Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/), under the supervision of [Martin Davies](http://www.mkdavies.net/Martin_Davies/Home.html), then Wilde Reader in Mental Philosophy. I then took up a lectureship in Psychology at King Alfred's College Winchester (now [University of Winchester](https://www.winchester.ac.uk/)). From there I moved to [Durham University](https://www.dur.ac.uk/), where I have been since 2003.
