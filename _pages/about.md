# Welcome 

I am an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology, Durham University, UK.

I am originally from New Zealand, where I completed BSc and MSc degrees in Psychology at the University of Canterbury, Christchurch. I moved to the UK to undertake a doctorate in the Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford, under the supervision of Martin Davies, then Wilde Reader in Mental Philosophy. I then took up a lectureship in Psychology at King Alfred's College Winchester (now University of Winchester). From there I moved to Durham, where I have been since 2003.
