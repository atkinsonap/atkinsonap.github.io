# Welcome to the Atkinson lab for Social Perception

## About me:
I am an Associate Professor in the [Department of Psychology, Durham University](https://www.dur.ac.uk/psychology/), UK.

I am originally from New Zealand, where I completed BSc and MSc degrees in [Psychology at the University of Canterbury](https://www.canterbury.ac.nz/science/schools-and-departments/psychology/), Christchurch. I moved to the UK to undertake a doctorate in the [Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/), under the supervision of [Martin Davies](http://www.mkdavies.net/Martin_Davies/Home.html), who was then Wilde Reader in Mental Philosophy. I then took up a lectureship in Psychology at King Alfred's College Winchester (now [University of Winchester](https://www.winchester.ac.uk/)). From there I moved to [Durham University](https://www.dur.ac.uk/), where I have been since 2003. I have held visiting research fellowships at the University of York (2001; host: Prof [Andy Young](https://www.york.ac.uk/psychology/staff/academicstaff/awy1/)) and the University of Iowa (2004; host: Prof [Ralph Adolphs](http://emotion.caltech.edu/)).
I am a member of the [Durham Centre for Imaging (DCI)](https://www.dur.ac.uk/psychology/research/dci/), of Durham University’s [Centre for Vision and Visual Cognition](https://www.dur.ac.uk/cvvc/), and of the Department of Psychology's [Perception, Action & Awareness](https://www.dur.ac.uk/psychology/research/paa/) research group.

## About the lab:
Our research focuses on the psychological and neural mechanisms underpinning our ability to perceive social information, such as emotions and personality traits, from faces and bodies. Current projects include:
- foveal vs. extrafoveal processing of features within faces underpinning emotion perception, with [Hannah Smithson](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/team/hannah-smithson) and PhD student [Nazire Duran](https://www.dur.ac.uk/psychology/staff/profile/?id=15229)
- visual perception of social interactions, with [Quoc Vuong](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/ion/staff/profile/quocvuong.html#background)

We are also engaging in collaborative work on visuomotor control (with [Dorothy Cowie](https://www.dur.ac.uk/psychology/staff/profile/?id=11703) and [Rachel Mowbray](https://www.dur.ac.uk/psychology/staff/profile/?id=16720)) and visual attention (with [Dan Smith](https://www.dur.ac.uk/psychology/staff/profile/?id=2836)), and on social cognition and communication in primates (with [Zanna Clay](https://www.dur.ac.uk/psychology/staff/profile/?id=16059) and [Mariska Kret](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/staffmembers/mariska-kret#tab-1)).
